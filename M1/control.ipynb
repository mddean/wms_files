The analysis and study of algorithms is an important subject in computer science, mathematics, and operations research. While we won't be deeply analyzing algorithms, understanding the basics of algorithms and how to represent them both visually and with pseudocode will help you as you develop more complex Python programs. \n",

    "When creating a flowchart, the flow often goes from the top of the page to bottom or from the left of the page to the right. Larger flowcharts might flow from the left to the right and continue on down the page over multiple pages. There are numerous standard flowchart symbols.

    "One of the most important steps to creating a flowchart is to carefully define the **boundaries** of the process you are modeling. Where, when, why, and how does the process begin? Who initiates the process? Similar questions need to be answered for the process end. The level of detail needed for describing the process should also be considered. Building a flowchart is often an iterative process. Start with broad steps to make sure you have defined the boundaries appropriately and captured all of the important aspects. Then continue to refine the flowchart, adding detail to the various steps. Including the stakeholders/business owners of the data analysis project at the flowchart phase and throughout the entire project will help ensure the project will be successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a flowhcart, writing pseudocode to add detail to the process helps as you begin to implement the process using Python code. **Pseudocode** can be thought of as a plain language description of the steps of an algorithm. While no broad standard for pseudocode syntax exists, you will see commonality among examples. In all cases pseudocode resembles skeleton programs to help break the \"messy problem\" into manageable chunks. The skeleton serves as a starting point to writing code.\n"

    "As an example, consider orders coming in from customers to your company. Receiving an order kicks off the process that we are trying to model, which is represented by the oval at the top left. When the order comes in we first check to see if all the required information to process the order is contained in the request. This branching point is representend by a diamond, where a response of \"Yes\" goes down the flowchart and the reponse of \"No\" goes to the right. If all of the required information was entered, we check the inventory levels for all of the items in the order. This step is represented by a rectangle. The result of the check is another branching point. If sufficient inventory exists, we generate a pick list and route it appropriately. Otherwise, we generate a partial pick list, route it appropriately, and send the customer an email that their order will be partially fulfilled now. If we can only partially fulfill the order, we add the unfinished part of the order to the \"partial queue\". After generating pick lists for either the full or partial order, our modeled process ends. Returning to the check for all of the required information when the order arrives, if it does not, we send the customer an email alerting them to the deficiency and then add the order to the \"incomplete queue.\" Afterwards, we end the modeled process. \n",

    "These operators are fairly self-explanatory, but one important issue is that the Python operator will stop evaluating a conditional statement as quickly as possible. Thus, if the first part of an `and` operation is `False` (or, conversely `True` for an `or` operation), the remaining part of the statement will not be processed since the overall result will be `False`. This approach is known as _short-circuiting_ and can produce faster code execution; however, it can easily lead to confusion if you perform function calls or variable creation in the latter parts of a conditional statement.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **loop** is defined as a segment of code that executes multiple times. An **iteration** refers to the process in which the code segment is executed once. A loop can undergo many iterations. There are two basic looping techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `while` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop will execute while a condition is `True`, as its name implies. The `while` loop first checks whether a condition is true. If it is, the loop takes some actions and then rechecks the condition. If the condition is true, the loop executes again. This process repeats until the condition is false. *Note:* This is where you can easily create an **infinite loop**, which is a very, very **bad** thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for a `while` loop is:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    statement 1\n",

    "\n",
    "A `for` loop is very similiar to a `while` loop. It will test a condition and execute the body of the loop if the condition is satisfied. The difference is that a `for` loop will *iterate*, or loop over, something automatically. You use a `for` loop when you know the number of times you need to execute the statements. You will encounter `for` loops very, very frequently. Therefore, you should gain a solid understanding of them. The syntax of a `for` loop is:\n",

The inner list contains the test scores for a student. First, we will try `break` when a student has a grade less than 80. This action will stop calculating the grade for that particular student and go to the next student. Then, we'll try using a `continue` statement when a student has a grade less than 80.
